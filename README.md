# hello-world

Excerpt from wikipedia:

On GitHub, if a Git repository has a README file in its main (top-level) directory, the README file is automatically converted into formatted HTML and presented on the main web page of the git repository, underneath the list of files and directories in the repository. Various different file extensions can be used, but there should not be more than one file named "README" at the top-level of a GitHub repository. The conversion to HTML takes account of the file extension of the file – for example, naming the README file for a GitHub repository "README.md" would cause GitHub to treat it as a GitHub-flavored Markdown file, which is also the default README file format on GitHub.

This makes using GitHub a low-effort way to create a web page for a git repository (GitHub also supports the publication of wikis and separate websites, which may be formatted however the developers want).

Because the GitHub web interface lets users edit a file in a relatively streamlined way, without manually cloning the repository and manually making a pull request, it supports wiki-style editing of the README file – with approval necessary by a committer (i.e. someone who has write access to the repository) if the user is not a committer themselves.

However, within the GitHub app for Android mobile devices, the contents of README files are not shown underneath the list of files, and nor are README files formatted as HTML when viewed.
